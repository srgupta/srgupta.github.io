        "When we learn, we make ourselves vulnerable. When we engage in learning, we communicate that we want to grow, to become better, to improve ourselvesâ€¦"
        - George Siemens, learning theorist

        As an undergraduate, I majored in Physics and Math. Whenever I told people that, they usually treated me as some really technical person. I never liked it, because what attracted me to those subjects most were in fact deeply human: imagination, creativity, inspiration, curiosity and wonder. I learned alot in college, but like many students I found that the reality of formal education often didn't match up to the deep sense of engagement true learning provides.

        I was attracted to DBC because of its emphasis on learning pedagogy, but after watching Shereef talk about the experiment that is DBC, I'm kinda sold. I love how developing a kitchen mindset - the assumption that our experience of learning is entirely dependent not just on what DBC provides, but what we bring to table too - is built in to the program. I love how producing - rather than consuming - our learning is expected, not some afterthought. And I love how when everyone is willing to co-create - to give and to receive - from day one offers the potential to truly change the game when it comes to how much we can transform ourselves. In sum, I love how being human - curious, creative, vulnerable - will be inherent to how we learn to code.

      I suppose there are risks. Namely, will I be able to express my fears and vulnerabilities, when I've spent a lifetime avoiding them???
