  <h1>Version Control: </h1>
  <h2>The Big Picture</h2>
  <h4>December, 2014</h4>

        Before trying to understand what version control is, I found it helpful to understand why we need it; and, I began to understand why after realizing that Version Control Systems can be - and are - used for almost anything, not just software development.

        Thinking about the familiar case of writing a short essay, for example, you probably begin the paper with a sentence, add another, and another, etc. Along the way, you might delete, modify, or add stuff, i.e. make changes. More often than not, when you're done, you want to change things, including restoring some of those changes you made earlier.

        This is only possible if you've kept those changes of course, which is what writers do (through some system of drafts, edits, revisions). This "system" can be as simple as the one your grade school teacher used: a red pen marking up your draft, which you save before creating a new draft with the suggested edits. Version control systems, in the broadest sense I suppose, are really just these sorts of methods one uses to track changes during the progression of work.

        These sorts of hacked version control systems are fine for the simple, everyday things we do, but for more complex projects lots of things can go wrong: you lose the changes you've been working on, you save changes that overwrite files you didn't want, you forget where one of your files or folders is located, etc. This is where git comes in: git is just software - installed on your computer - that tracks and records changes. It's a tool to formally manage the progression of your work. You can *git-track* just about any file, using the command *git add*. *Any* changes you now make will be tracked, and, if you want to revert to or compare a previous version of your project from your current one, with git you easily can. If you're ready to save your changes, just use the command *git commit*, which is like saving a "snapshot" or "draft" of your work. Git even lets you leave a message, like a reminder or sticky-note, so you can recall why you made those changes.

        Though odds are, you're not working alone, and managing work becomes exponentially more complex as your team grows. This has always been true, and I suppose that's why companies - and office space - were invented (to manage the costs of collaboration and coordination). GitHub, then, is kinda like office space that allows developers to collaborate, but office space that takes advantage of the architecture of the internet and web: digital, distributed, connected. Instead of meeting in a physical location, developers meet on GitHub, starting a master repository (that is located *remotely* on some server) that everyone can copy *locally* to their computer using git. This interaction between local and remote is largely managed by *pulling* projects from GitHub, then *pushing* changes back. The work of individual developers can then be *merged* into the master project.
