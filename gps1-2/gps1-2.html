    <h3>What is Pair Programming?</h3>
    <p>Pair Programming is a technique in software development where two people code on the same project at once.
    Each person takes a distinct role, either driver or navigator. </p>

    <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
    <p>Pair programming is important to DBC because it has actually become a part of the industry.
    No one does programming by themselves anymore. It saves time, money and energy to work with
    someone else as opposed to working by yourself. Errors can be caught much more quickly having
    another pair of eyes on block of code.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="driver">
    <h3>Compare Driver and Navigator</h3>
    <p>The navigator is the "head" of the pair, and the driver executes the directions.</p>
